I love reading and literary criticism. Join me on this literary voyage this year
as I write about what I'm reading. I won't just be reading classics, or even
just fiction. I'll be reading some philosophy, history, programming books, a
juicy memoir, and more. Sometimes I'll write about other things like literary
critical theories.

## What I'm reading now

- _Lost Illusions_, Honor√© de Balzac
- Critique of Pure Reason (
