I love reading and literary criticism. Join me on this literary voyage this year
as I write about what I'm reading. I won't just be reading classics, or even
just fiction. I'll be reading some philosophy, history, programming books, a
juicy memoir, and more. Sometimes I'll write about other things like literary
critical theories.

## What I'm reading now

Although I've been finding reading a single book at a time most rewarding, I'm
still finding it hard to escape my habit of having 4+ books going at a time.

- _Lost Illusions_, Honor√© de Balzac
- _Critique of Pure Reason_, Immanuel Kant (Analysis, outlining)
- _Best New Poets of 2014_ Laux and Danziger eds. (Just finished)
- _Epistle to the Romans_, Karl Barth

However, the _Critique_ is my 2nd read-through, and I'll probably be working
through this difficult book over the next year or more since it deserves this
treatment. Same with Barth.

_Lost Illusions_ is going well, so I will be writing about it soon. I'm about
halfway done with this portrait of early 1800s French life.
