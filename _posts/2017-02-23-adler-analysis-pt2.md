## Inspectional Reading

In the [previous post](2017-02-06-adler-analysis.md), I talked about a book I
shunned for years to my detriment: _How to Read a Book_ by Mortimer J. Adler. I
told of how the book has come to be my main method for analyzing non-fiction
texts.

_Analyzing_ is a misleading word. It sounds like a lot of work. In some cases it
is. However, the good news is that Adler's preliminary techniques give great
gains in gleaning meaning from the text without much effort. A welcome
combination!

Adler calls these preliminary techniques _inspectional reading_, and the main
purpose of this phase is to get a feel for what the book is about and whether
it's even worth reading at all. These are meant to be used in order, but I've
found you don't have to be too strict. Even Adler said that experienced readers
will run through these without thinking about it much. 

Inspectional reading has two phases, pre-reading and superficial reading.

## Pre-reading

Also called skimming, the main point of this phase is to determine if the book
is even worth reading at all. It's great for when you're at a bookstore,
library, or milling through a free bookshelf. Life is too short to waste on
2nd-rate books, and this I can attest that this has been very rewarding for me.

This phase consists of several methods to be used roughly in this order:

1. Read title page and preface
1. Study the table of contents
1. Glance at the index
1. Read the publishers blurb on the back or dust jacket
1. Skim chapters that seem crucial to the argument
1. Frolic about reading a paragraph here and there, never more than a few pages

I admit, "frolic" is my word. He calls it "dipping in here and there."

You read the title page and preference with the goal of figuring out the main
point of the book. You can also get an idea of the kind of book it is (important
in the more in-depth analysis stages later). In high school and early college, I
was the like so many who didn't want to mess with prefaces and intros. They felt
like a waste of time. Now I see these as (more often than not) one of the best
parts of a book. I don't think anything is more telling to me of whether a book
is worth reading than the preface. Also, I've often read a preference and been
convinced I don't need to read the book now, but need to someday.

When studying the table of contents, you want to get an idea of the book's
structure. In most kinds of non-fiction books, it's a bad sign when there is no
table of contents, or a paltry one with two or three points. I definitely
recommend not looking at this until after reading the title and preface. Usually
I don't have enough to go on by going straight to the table of contents.

Many people overlook the index. Most don't even bother with it. I was fortunate
as a teenager when an intellectual uncle of mine said, "I judge a book by its
index. Rarely has that failed me." Long before I read _How to Read a Book_ I had
come to value the index, but Adler enhanced my appreciation for a good index.
Why is this extremely dry, boring looking part in the back valuable? Why in
this age of digital books would this be useful at all? The point of the index,
I've learned, isn't so much to provide another kind of table of contents, but to
give you a good idea of the important terms and ideas. Some indexes will
boldface or italicize important words. If they don't, you'll get an idea by
looking at the number of pages related words have.

In short, whereas a table of contents reveals the structure of the book, the
index shows the relative weight of ideas found in a book. I can imagine that a
really cool digital upgrade of the index could be made for digital copies, but I
haven't seen anything like this yet.

The publishers blurb is another thing people tend to skip, I've heard, but I
always liked reading them, even as a child. This alone probably saved me many
hours of bad reading. Although they have an obvious commercial spin, they tend
to be like the preface in miniature. If you don't have time to read the preface,
at least read the blurb. I don't find that it matters when you read this--I
usually read it after reading the title but before reading the preface.

I admit I haven't done much with "skimming chapters that seem pivotal to the
argument." If I get to this point, I'm usually already convinced I need to do at
least a superficial read. Even so, when I've done this, it has been useful. I
also have trouble differentiating between this and the last step (frolicking).
However, I would say one thing. I think before I read _How to Read a Book_, I
would flip through a book like this first. I'd highly recommend moving this
until after you've done the previous steps. Doing it this way is purposeful and
more revealing than a random sampling of the books pages. If you have time to do
a bit of this, though, don't skip it. I've occasionally found that a promising
book (based on ToC, index, preface, etc.) didn't seem worth my time anymore
after reading pages here and there.

Again, it would be difficult to use some of these stages on fiction. At least I
haven't found it to be very useful. Also, despite what one of my favorite
English professors said, I still like to read a work that is new to me without
knowing much about it. I like to feel the impact of the surprises.
