## Inspectional Reading (part 2)

In the [previous post](2017-02-23-adler-analysis-pt2.md), I introduced the types
of inspectional reading Adler defines. We looked at the first, pre-reading, which
was a grab-bag of tips and techniques for using things like the title, preface,
and even the index to get a good sense of what the book is about and whether
it's even worth reading.

Now we'll look at the second kind of inspectional reading: superficial
reading.

## Superficial Reading

This is as simple as it gets. Read the book from cover to cover without ever
going back to re-read anything.

It sounds easy, but the not going back to re-read anything bit takes a lot of
discipline! The first time I tried this I was shocked by how often I went back
over previous sentences to try to comprehend them.

Wait, so why wouldn't you go back and re-read something if you didn't comprehend
it? Because in this stage, the goal is not comprehension, but familiarity.

When I first hear a piece of music, especially one with a lot of complexity to
it like Miles Davis' _In A Silent Way_ or a Beethoven symphony, I miss a lot.
Probably more than 30%. Maybe even 80%. But I never stop the piece and go
backâ€”not on the first listen. I just listen from beginning to end.

There's been a lot of music that I didn't enjoy the first time I heard it, but
I've learned that if the musician is considered one of the masters of their kind
of music, I'm probably just not familiar enough with it. Often if I just listen
to it 5 to 20 more times, it comes to life and I wonder why I missed out all
these years not enjoying their music.

Books have the same potential. Especially difficult books.  I recently tried
this with one of the most difficult books ever written: Kant's _Critique of Pure
Reason_. I felt like I only understood 2% of the book. Even more depressing is
that it still took me probably 100 hours or more to finish it, even at that. Yet
now that I've gone back and started to outline the book and do deeper analysis,
I can't believe how much I understand. I might even understand 15% to 30% of it.
Somehow, the important ideas rise to the top.

So do yourself a favor and do a fast, steady read through a difficult book. It
could be James Joyce's _Ulysses_, a Shakespeare play, a philosophy book, or
something you tried to read before but gave up. Read as fast as you can while
still registering the words or phrases. If you know spead-reading techniques,
this is a good place to use them, but it isn't necessary. The only crucial thing
is not to look back, no matter how tempting, until you finish the book.
