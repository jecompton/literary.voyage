## Inspectional Reading (part 2)

In the [previous post](2017-02-23-adler-analysis-pt2.md), I introduced the types
of inspectional reading Adler defines. We looked at the first, pre-reading, which
was a grab-bag of tips and techniques for using things like the title, preface,

it's even worth reading.

Now we'll look at the second kind of inspectional reading: superficial
reading.
